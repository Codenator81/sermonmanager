Here is where I am at:
* I have the database structure setup for four models: 
** Sermon
** Speaker
** Series
** Service
* I have the relationships for these models defined. (I hope correctly)
* I have the navigation for these models defined in plugin.php


Next Steps:

** Set up the controllers list and forms for each model.
* Add some sample data
* Create controllers
* write the markup for each controller to access the models to get display the data via TWIG.
